# Node-JS-README-Generator

## Description

README documents are critical for understanding how a project functions and how to navigate and interact with its numerous files in order to make the best use of any given project. Creating README files can be a bit time-consuming, so I utilized Node.JS to create a README Generator to expedite the process.

## Installation

To access the README Generator, you'll need to clone the repo at the link below:

Then, you'll need to initialize Inquirer using the following command in the terminal:
`npm init`

## Usage

Then, answer all of the questions given in the terminal in order to quickly generate a README file.
